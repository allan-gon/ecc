## Vector Review
- some component stuff
- light otuch on unit vectors
- to make a unit vector out of some generic vector v simply divide the components by it's norm: $\vec v = <x, y>$ then the unit vector u is: $\vec u = 1/|v|<x, y>$

## Electricity
- 2 types of electrinc charge positive (+) and negative (-)
- like charges repel
- opposite charges attract
- charges come from protons (+) and electrons (-). The absense on electrons makes a positive charge since the protons charge is unbalanced and the abundance of electrons causes a negative charge since this over powers the protons' charge
- $E = 1.602 x 10^{-19} C$
- $C$ (coulomb)
- no charge means equal number of protons and electrons ($e^-$)

**Expirement**
- rubbing a plastic rod with fur has the rod acquire a negative elctric charge. It takes electrons from the fur. Because the 2 rods where negatively charged they repelled
- rubbing the glass rod with silk results in the glass rod acquiring a positive electric charge. Does so because it loses electrons to the silk

- `Coulomb's Law`: two point charges (q<sub>1</sub> & q<sub>2</sub>) separated by some distance r exert forces on each other. The magnitude of the force is given by: $F = |1/4 \pi \epsilon_0 \times q_1 q_2/r^2|$
    - **Note**: $\epsilon_0 = 8.854 \times 10^{-12} C^2/N \cdot m^2$
    - r is the distance
    - for simplicity left $k = 1/4 \pi \epsilon_0 \equiv 8.99 \times 10^9 N \cdot m^2 / C^2$
    - finally: $F = |k q_1 q_2 / r^2|$
