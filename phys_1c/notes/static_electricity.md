# Static Electricity
- the idea of static electricty is that when you rub two things together something happens to have them develop charges (equal and opposite?)
- opposite charges attract
- same charges repel
- matter is made if
    - `electron` ($e^-$): negative
    - `proton` ($p^+$): positive
    - `nuetron` ($n^0$): nuetral
- by rubbing two objects together, electron flow from one object to another. The other object becomes positively charged because it's missing electrons. This is `charging by conduction`
    - means touching something, using that friction from rubbing to charge something
- an electric charge is an electron that carries a negative charge. Does it have more or less that it naturally would causing the negative or postitive charge respectively

# Electric charges and conservation
- units for electric charges are `Coulomb` or `C`. This is actually a massive charge. To put this into perspective, lighting transfers ~30 C
- you can't write a coulumb in terms of other units
- an electric ($q$) charge is a scalar
- the charge of an electron: $q = -1.6 \times 10^{-19}C$
    - $q = -e$
- the charge of a proton: $q = +e$
- the total charge of an object: $Q = \pm Ne$
    - N is a whole number
- given the charge of an object, in order to find out how many extra electrons it has, convert to coulomb and divide by the charge of an electron
    - ex: $Q = -6 \mu C$ => $N = Q/e$ => $N = -6 \times 10^{-6} C / -1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ => $N = 3.75 \times 10^{13}$
