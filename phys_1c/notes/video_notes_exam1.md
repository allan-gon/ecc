# Electric Charges and Electric Fields
- protons and electrons have the same charge: $e = \pm 1.60 \times 10^{-19} C$
- `Coulomb's Law`: $\vec F_e = k \frac {q_1 q_2}{r^2} \hat r$
    - where $k = 9.0 \times 10^9 \frac {N \cdot m^2}{C^2}$
    - q is each of the charges
    - r is the distance between them
    - $\hat r$ is the vector directed from one charge to the other
- Alternitavely if you only care about magnitude: $\| \vec F \| = k |\frac {q_1 q_2}{r^2}|$
    - By the way $k \equiv \frac {1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}$
    - $\epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \frac {C^2}{N \cdot m^2}$
- `Law of Conservation of Charge`: the net charge of an isolated system doesn't change
    - typically eclectrons move in a system but in isolated systems there's no way for electrons to leave or enter so the **net charge** of the system stays constant
- Bringing 2 objects close to each other causes electrostatic forces between charges and can change the distribution of electrons in the objects or polarize the objects
- `Polarize`: when a charged object comes close to a nuetral object, the charged object can induce charge by having the electrons move around. The net charge remains because there is no loss or gain but this movement of electrons makes parts of the nuetral object more positive or negative
- `Ground`: nuetrally charge, infinite well of electrons. Can take from or dump into a ground, electrons
- $\vec E = \frac {\vec F_e}{q}$
    - units of $\frac {N}{C}$
- $\| \vec E \| = \frac {kQ}{r^2}$
- `Electric Field Lines`: in the direction a small, positive, test charge would experience an electrostactic force
    - the more tighly packed the lines, the stronger the electric field in that area
    - start on (+) and end on (-)
- `Conductors`: allows electrons to move
- `Insulators`: resist the motion of electrons

# Continuous Charge Distributions
- a charge that isn't a point charge, has a shape
- $\vec E = k \int \frac {dq}{r^2} \hat r$
- `linear charge density`: $\lambda = \frac {Q}{L}$
    - units: $\frac {C}{m}$
- `surface charge density`: $\sigma = \frac {Q}{A}$
    - units: $\frac {C}{m^2}$
- `volumetric charge density`: $\rho = \frac {Q}{V}$
    - units: $\frac {C}{m^3}$

# Flux and Gauss' Law
- $\Phi_e = \vec E \cdot \vec A \equiv EA \cos \theta$
    - $\Phi_{total} = \Sigma \Phi$
    - here $\vec A$ is the area vector
