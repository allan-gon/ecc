TODO: find better naming scheme figure out how to stitch these notes together

# SHM Recap
- $m \frac {d^2 x}{dt^2} = - kx$
- $\frac {d^2 x}{dt^2} = - \frac {k}{m} x$
- $x(t) = Acos(\omega t)$
- $\omega ^2 = \frac {k}{m}$
- Generally when a coordinate obets an eqn: $\frac {d^2 z}{dt^2} = - \omega^2 z$
    - $z(t) = Acos(\omega t + \phi)$

# Homework
- syllabus describes how he want homework formatted

# Electric Fields
- alternative picure to Coulomb's law: electric charges set up electric fields. Electric fields exert forces on other charges
- for a single (+) charge, the electric field ($\vec E$) points **away** from the charge. The strength decreases with respect to distance
- for a single (-) charge the $\vec E$ points toward the charge. Strength decreases with respect to distance from the charge
- $\vec E = \frac {kq}{r^2} \hat r$
    - r is the magnitude of the distance vector and $\hat r$ is the unit vector
- the number of lines is directly proportional to the strength of the charge
- visually, where the LOEF are concentrated (closer), the strength of the electric field is stronger

TODO: include electric field diagram, and electrice field lines (arrows vs lines)

- lines over vectors for di-pole
- `electric dipole`: pair of opposite, equally strong, charges

# Connecting $\vec E$ to Forces
- charge $q$ experiences an electric field $\vec E$. The force on $q$ is $\vec F = q \vec E$
- unit of $\vec E$ is $\frac {N}{C}$
