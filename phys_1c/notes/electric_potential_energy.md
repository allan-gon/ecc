# Electric Potential Energy
- $\Delta KE = W$
- $KE_f - KE_i = W$
- $W = \frac {kQq}{r}$
- $U_E = \frac {kq_1q_2}{r}$
- the pair has PE (not an individual charge)
- $U_E$ is (+) for like charges and (-) for opposite charges
- $U = 0$ when charges are $\infty$ apart

Ex:

# Electric Potential
- we have some region of space permeated by an electric field. We have some charge q in the region the travels from some initial position to some final position. The charge is acted on by the electric force ($\vec F = q \vec E$). As the charge goes from $x_0$ -> $x_f$ how much does it's potential energy change?
- $\Delta U_E = -W_E$ -> $\Delta U_E = - \int^f_i \vec F \cdot d \vec x$ -> $\Delta U_E = - \int^f_i q \vec E \cdot d \vec x$ -> $\frac {\Delta U_E}{q} = - \int^f_i \vec E \cdot d \vec x$
- `electric potential/voltage`: $V \equiv \frac {U_E}{q}$
    - units of *Volt*(V): $\frac {J}{C}$
- $V_b - V_a = - \int^b_a \vec E \cdot d \vec x$
    - the difference in voltage/potential betwen a and b
- units of $\vec E$ can be $\frac {V}{m}$ or $\frac {N}{C}$
