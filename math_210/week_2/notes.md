# Logical Rules of inference

- `Modus Ponens`: `((p -> q) ^ p) ∴ q` If it rains, then I get wet. It rains therefore I get wet.
- `Modus Tollens`: `((p -> q) ^ ~q) ∴ ~p` If it rains, then I get wet. I didn't get wet therefore it didn't rain.
- `Hypothetical Syllogism`: `(p -> q) ^ (q -> r) ∴ p -> r`
- `Disjunctive Syllogism`: `((p v q) ^ ~p) ∴ q`
- `Addition`: `p ∴ (p v q)`
- `Simplificiation`: `(p ^ q) ∴ p`
- `Conjunction`: `p ^ q ∴ p ^ q`

# Valid Arguments
- have nothing to do with the premises being true. it's about the form of the argument. does it follow the rules of inference or not
- assume conclusion is false
- go premise by premise and try to make each true while sticking to truth values
- if all the premises are true when the conclusion is false, that's an invalid argument

# Proof
- state given premises
- state steps that follow logically given rules of inference (ae. ~(c v d) Moden Ponens lines 3 & 4)
