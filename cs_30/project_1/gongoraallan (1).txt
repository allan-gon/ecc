one was edge case for adding names i think
fixed 60. problem was with destruction in assignment when swapping

calling delete on this does successfully call the destructor code, however
it crashes immediately after destructor finishes why? To be clear
the destructor runs perfectly, but when it scope is done cpp kys.

82/83:
weird behavior. they sometimes pass, sometimes fail, but never together
