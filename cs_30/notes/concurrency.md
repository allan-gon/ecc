# What is concurrency
- 2 or more independent activities happening at the same time
- we have computers with multiple cores that are capable of running more than one task in parallel. Known as `Hardware Concurrency`

# Approaches to Concurrency
## Multiple Single threaded processes
## Multiple thread s in a single process
- `thread`: a lightweight process
- independent of each other but share same address space
  - most data can be accessed from all threads

# Multithreading in C++
- include `thread`
- in main create a thread object that launches a function or set of functions

# ASK HIM TO INCLUDE FREEGLUT FROM SCRATCH

for my parsing problem, would multi-threading or multi-processing make more sense

i used one of them but never pushed the changes so i cant check what i actually did
