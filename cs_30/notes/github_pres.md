# What is it
## Git
- a version control system
    - this means that it tracks changes to files over time
- the command line interface
- the same way you save a game so that if you die your progress isn't lost, you save your code so that if for some reason you must go back to the previous version you can

## GitHub
- the website that stores the files
- if you have collaborators on a project or wish to display a project on a resume you will likely use github

# Why use it
- all developers have a version of the code on their system so everyone can work simultaneously
- it easy to save changes and pull the updated code. Do you really want to email every dev your updated code 

# Initial Set-up
- connecting an account
- auth keys 

# Common commands
## `add`

## `commit`

## `push`

## `pull`

## `checkout`

## `clone`
