After reading "The Case for Getting Rid of Borders" by Alex Tabarrok I haven't formed a stance yet but admittedly I'm skeptical. This wasn't a formal argument so it may be unfair to expect this but where was the opposing viewpoint that was proven to be false? Most of the "arguments" simply felt like statements. For instance, when she talks about how open borders would double world GDP, there was no build up or support for why world GDP is a good metric for success (after a cursory google search it seem sGPI would have been a better metric). I think the better argument was the part about real wages increasing. We live in the real world not a utopia; I would like to know about any drawbacks or common misconception people have about the arguments presented but was left empty handed. I don't believe I hold a significant bias against this argument, not because I'm infallible, but because my gripes are that this article wasn't very convincing/argumentative.

Other people might immediately start touting open borders as a good idea because they're more informed than me or because it feels like the morally just position. Admittedly, I don't know anything about the topic and since the arguments have to with the economy, I'm ill equipped to engage with this. A more dismissive reason someone may take the opposing view point is the moral stance. It feels bad to take the dissenting stance because the article makes it sound like it is a moral imperative to allow for open borders; but, I'm not against the idea I would just like to be more informed before I take a stance. It feels like the author didn't even acknowledge the other side.
