# Toulmin Model
- claim + grounds + warrant = argument
- `grounds`: a stand in for evidence. strongest peice of evidence. direct proof
    - can be based on direct evidence (facts, stats, physical proof), source credibility (authorities, experts), analysis + reasoning, and premises (values/morals) held by listener
- `warrant`: logical leap that connects teh claim with the grounds. Doesn't try to prove claim, helps prove the grounds
    - `implicit`: ...
    - `explicit`: ...
    - can be based on the same thing
    - used to hold up the evidence as true or credible
- something like values as grounds is weak so warrant is required to defend this evidence
