# Part 1
1. What is the mass of the block
2. Set everything up and add 200 grams to the block
3. Irrelevant step

```
iteration = 0
while iteration < 6:
    4. Find `m2_min`, the heaviest m2 such that m1 stops moving after you tap it
    5. Find `m2_min`, the lightest m2 such that m1 moves at a constant velocity
    6. Find `m2_best`, the average of `m2_max` and `m2_min`
    m1 += 100
```

# Part 2
1. Disconnect m1 from m2
2. Irrelevant step
3. Find `Î¸_min`, the largest angle for which
