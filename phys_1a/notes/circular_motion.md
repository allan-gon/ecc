# Centripetal Force
- present whenever an object is moving in a circle
- can be given by different forces (friction, tension, normal, gravity). Is situational
- equation F<sub>c</sub> = (mass * velocity<sup>2</sup>)/ radius
- from F = ma we get: ma<sub>c</sub> = (m * v<sup>2</sup>)/ r => a<sub>c</sub> = v<sup>2</sup> / r
