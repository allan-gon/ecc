# Measurement + Device
- device sets the error
- when measuring with a stick use the 2cm mark since you can clearly see it as opposed to 1cm
- ask wahts the smallest division/precision

- read the main scale (0, the sliding part)
- find the 1st line that perfectly lines up on both
- - add that value to the main scale

- when adding, add the errors to get th enew error
- when reportinh error, if the lead digit of the error is one, keep 2 sig figs. then match the measurement'd decimals places to the erros decimal places
- if the lead digit it not a one, keep 1 sigfig in the error

- when multiplying, find the percent error then round with the rule of one from above
- then, sum the % errors and again round using rule of one
- convert % error to absolute error ((area/100)*% error) again round with rule of one
- round the answer given the error. in the final answer, answer +/- absolute error (+/- % error)

Ex: x +/- delta x = (delta x/ x) * 100

# Report
- Get an unknown (U-#)
- Get the length (including the absolute error and % error) using vernier
- Get the Diameter ^ using micrometer
- Area ^
- Volume ^
