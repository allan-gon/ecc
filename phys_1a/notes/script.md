# F=ma
- most of the rules are the same
    - identify forces
    - draw a FBD
    - select coordinate system
    - write a table
- the new steps are, draw all the free body diagrams before selecting a coordinate system
- select a coordinate system such that the acceleration is along a positive axis
- in the table set the sum of force to equal mass * acceleration

- other notes are constraints
- often, if there are several masses there is some relationship between each masses acceleration.
    - perhaps there magnitude is the same
    - maybe one is the other scaled?
- finding the constraint is related to how the two masses are connected
- often this is by a string and pulley
