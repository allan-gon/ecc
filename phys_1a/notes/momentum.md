# What is momentum?
- mass in motion

$\vec{p} = m \vec{v}$

- it does have direction

# What is Impulse
- the change in momentum

$J = F \Delta{t} \equiv m \Delta{v} \equiv \Delta{p}$

- also the integral of a force time graph

## Building relatoinships
$F_{net} = m \Delta{v}/ \Delta{t} \equiv \Delta{p}/\Delta{t}$

# Collisions

|| Elastic | Inelastic | Perfectly Inelastic |
|---|---|---|---|
| $p_{tot}$ | conserved | conserved | conversed |
| $k_{tot}$ | conserved | **NOT** conserved (loss or gain) |  **NOT** conserved (max loss) |

## Examples
- if 2 balls bounce of each other it could be elastic or inelastic. Depends on if $k$ is conserved
- if 2 object stick together, completely inelastic

# Conservation of Momentum
$p_0 = p_f$

For inelastic collisions:
$m_a v_{a0} + m_b v_{b0} = m_a v_{af} + m_b v_{bf}$

For elastic collisions, also:
$v_{a0} + v_{af} = v_{b0} + v_{bf}$

$v_{2f} - v_{1f} = -(v_{2i} - v_{1i})$

# Coroneus
- $dI = Fdt = dp$
- newton second law: $F = dp/dt$
