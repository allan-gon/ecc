## Case 0 (missing y and y')
- of the form: $y'' = f(x)$
- simply take a double integral

## Case 1 (missing y)
- of the form: $y'' = f(x, y')$
- substitute $u = y'; u' = y''$

## Case 2 (missing x)
- y'' = f(y, y')
- substitute $V = y'; V'V = y''$
    - **NOTE** y is treated as the independent variable

## Gotchas
- When getting to a sol to a diff eq you can treat the constants as just that, but to solve for the constants, differentiate the sol so that the relation holds $y = cx^3; y = 3cx^2$
