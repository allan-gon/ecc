# Summary
- humans live in a cave, light reaches inside
- it's been this way since childhood, there are chained up and can't move so they can only see infront of them
- behind them is a fire and marionette players cast shadows that the prisoners can see
- these shadows were of various things (statues lions, etc)
- since the prisoners can't see these people speaking, they would think that the voices they hear are that of the shadows
- to them, the truth would be nothing but the shadows if the images
- if the prisoners were corrected, allowed to see the truth, they would be distressed, unable to see th erealities which the shadows temmed from
- knowing the truth even if it may be painul or bring hardships is better than being ignorant and happy

# Matrix Notes
Identify 2 points of comparison
Neo starts in a simulated reality much like the prisoners of the cave. Though the prisoners live in the real world because of how they lived + the fallibility  of the senses, it was essentially a lie, their shadow world.
This one is more general. There are several points during the movie that characters say something to the effect of, “That’s impossible”, because they don’t understand the world around them.
Neo is aware that something is not right in his world just not what specifically. He is like Glaucon. He needs the help of an instructor to `get out` of the cave.
The senses don’t always provide reliable and accurate information
When Trinity removes the bug Agent Smith put into Neo, he yells, “Jesus christ, that thing’s real?”. Questioning what he just saw, his senses.
When Neo first meets Morpheus,  Morpheus explains the matrix. This is the lead up to the red pill scene. “It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth…That you are a slave Neo. Like everyone else, you were born into bondage. Born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch.”
When Morpheus and Co. rescue Neo from the water, Neo asks, “Why do my eyes hurt?”, and Morpheus responds, “Because you’ve never used them before”. This parallels what Plato said in the allegory of the cave that when one leaves the cave they will need time to adjust and something eyes.
Socrates explains to Glaucon what will happen to a prisoner if he is freed. WIll suffer sharp pains and be distressed by the bright light. When he is shown the error in his ways, he will be confused and prefer the old ways. Part 2 @ 17 minutes
Morpheus is a guide, enlightening Neo
What is real scene. part 2 @ 12 minutes
