# The US Education System is Broken

## Background
- `Horace Mann` created school in 1838. Has 6 principles
- the reason for early education (factory work) is vastly different than why we have education now. New jobs means we need t teach new things. Traditional subjects are still useful but space must be made for newer, more relevant stuff.

## Problems
- we, as a country are under preforming
- teachers are paid so little
    - pay does not match the depth of the job
    - have to teach
    - prepare for standard tests
    - be a therapist/social worker
    - learn to teach remotely
- privatization
- outdated
    - not teaching applicable things
    - not teaching new, more common things like coding
