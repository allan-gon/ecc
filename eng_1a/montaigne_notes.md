# Prompt
- Argue whether Montaigne’s theory of teaching and learning (pedagogy) should be adopted by modern public education systems. 
- Identify and analyze one principle of his pedagogy, and use quotations, explanation, and examples to demonstrate the principle.

# Summary
<!-- (page number, paragraph number) -->
- there's an idea that an able/well-made man is better than a well-learned man (235, 2)
- learning should be more conversational not simply lecture (235, 3)
- because of the authority we give teachers, students no longer think for themselves because they simply take everything the teacher says as an absolute truth (236, 7)
- teachers ought to show students a variety of ideas and have them filtyer out what is important/correct as opposed to students being sponges that absorb everything the teacher says (236, 8)

# Teach at student level
- teaching should be based on the capacity of the student (235, 3)
- teach a student at their level (235, 4)
- of course our student fail if we teach in only one manner (235, 5)
# Application
- don't simply ask the student what he learned. words are weak. have him prove that he learned by applying (235, 6)
- if a student embraces an idea by their own choice the idea is now the students, transformed in some way. a student must merinate in the ideas of the teacher not take them wholesale. (236, 8)
- To know by heart is not to know; it is to retain what we have given our memory to keep (237, 11)
- Practice/application should have more emphasis. Can we really learn to dance just from watching and never practicing? (236, 12)
